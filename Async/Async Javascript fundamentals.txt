Js is synchronous single threaded language which executes sequentially.
We have API's which allow us to write the asynchronous code like setTimeOut etc.
Javascript engine = heap + call stack
Js engine (V8) is always used with some runtime environment like browser, nodejs, deno etc for asynchronous programming.
When JS engine finds asynchronous block it does not go in the call stack rather it goes to the task queue, then task queue add it to the call stack.

blocking code : 
wait i am coming don't do any thing else (Read file Sync)

non blocking code : 
wait i am coming you can do your work while i am coming (Read file Async)

fetch: in this we have a promise thing (high pripority)
which says if it's done than ok or do it later
