// primitive data types 

// 7 TYPES:string, Number, boolean, null, undefiend, symbol, bigint
// symbol we use to make any variable unique 

//reference (non primitive)

//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. 
//This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it.
// You can assign different types of values to a variable during its lifetime.
